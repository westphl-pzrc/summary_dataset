# summary_dataset
Summary dataset for the Promise Zone

NOTE:
  -these data are *estimates*
  -the delayed release of 2020 US Census summary file 1 makes it impossible to use more accurate population-based weighting, so this pull uses area weights only
  -this dataset combines data from 2019, 2020, and 2021 depending on the most recently-available dataset
